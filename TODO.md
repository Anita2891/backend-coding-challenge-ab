    -Can we use a database? What for? SQL or NoSQL?

    Its technically possible to use for storing gists, it's not the most effecient or practical solution as GitHub has already built-in features for creating and managing gists.

    It's not recommended to use a database for gists,if you must do, you use document oriented databases such as MongoDB (NoSQL) as the data from gists is a key value pair.

    Can we useful in the application where it is important to quickly identify and summarize the main points of large amount of information and to copy specific file code from one place to another or to define the requirements.txt file for a project without going through each file to check import pattern.

    Can be useful for content curation, document and knowledge management to store main points of each gist, source, files. This will allow us to quickly search and browse through large information to see at a glance the main points/information.

    - How can we protect the api from abusing it?

    Strategies to protect APIs from abuse are:
    a) Authentication and Authorization : Use API key, OAuth tokens or authentication methods to identify authentic user
    b) Rate Limiting or API throttling: To limit number of requests that user can make within a specific time interval- can protect againsts DOS attacks-- can be done by Flask-Limiter library  and @limiter.limit("15/minute")
    c) API Security: Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), input validation,parameter sanitization and output encoding
    d) API monitoring: Using logging, metrics monitoring, anomaly detection tools to detect suspicious abnormal activities
    e) Usage guidlines, best practices and trouble shooting API documentation

    - How can we deploy the application in a cloud environment?

    1) Choose cloud platform: in my case i tried Heroku cloud in one of project
    2) Set up environment: typically creating containers like container(Docker) or serverless function
    3) Install dependences: defined in requirement.txt file and here in .toml file
    4) Configure the environment: set environmental variables, db settings (.env)
    5) Upload the application on cloud- copy files to virtual machine (heroku push origin master)
    6) Test the application: test app in cloud environment - may be in cloud you need to change configuration or code
    7) Monitor application: Monitor app to ensure performance, no issues and errors

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - How can we be sure the application is alive and works as expected when deployed into a cloud environment?

    To ensure the application run correctly and permforming as aspected, the ways are:
    a) Automated testing: automated test suite to run against application to ensure its working as aspected to catch issues before.
    b) Monitoring: Use monitoring tools to track application's performance and detect errors-by setting an alert 
    c) Logging: Use logging to record important errors and events to track bugs and diagonse issue
    d) Load testing: Test the app under load to ensure it can handle expected number of users and transactions to test real world usage and performance bottlenecks
    e) Manual testing: Perform manual testing to ensure application is working as aspected
